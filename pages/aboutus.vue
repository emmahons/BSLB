            <h2 class=""> The Collection</h2>
            <p> Welcome to the archive. This is a digital collection of some of the books from the special collection of
                the Sint-Lukas library in Brussels. This library is part of LUCA School of Arts and can be visited by
                students as well as other individuals interested in great art books. Our goal is to bring to light some
                of the magical books this collection has to offer. Due to the delicate nature of the books, they are not
                always on display in the library, but they deserve to be seen. </p>

            <h2 class="pt-20">Our Collections</h2>
            <p> Here at the library, we offer curated collections of our donors. Insert in this area a text about the
                collections that i will ask the librarians about thank you. </p>
